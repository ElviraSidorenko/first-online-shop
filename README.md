# 01 Project - Online Shop

## Brief

A client has come to you with a list of products and needs you to build them an online shop. They have provided a rough idea of the layout they want, and the content in a Google Document. You will need to design and build a website from these requirements.

The website needs to work across multiple screen sizes and use design principles to make the content easy to read. It needs to use semantic HTML and CSS for the page design.

## Rationale

Taking requirements from a customer and turning them into a website is a common requirement in the software industry. Ensuring you can translate design and content into semantic HTML, and writing good quality CSS is a critical skill as a web developer.
